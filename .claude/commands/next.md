Read the TASKS/ROADMAP.md file to understand the current project state and priorities.

Then find the next backlog task to implement by searching for `.backlog.md` files in the TASKS folder. Prioritize tasks in order:
1. Tasks in P1 (MVP Foundation) before P2 and P3
2. Lower epic numbers before higher ones (E03 before E04, etc.)
3. Lower task numbers before higher ones (SOC-62 before SOC-63, etc.)

Once you identify the next task:
1. Read the task file to understand the requirements
2. Read the epic's `_epic.md` file for context
3. Rename the task file from `.backlog.md` to `.in-progress.md` to mark it as started
4. Begin implementing the task following the coding best practices in CLAUDE.md
5. When complete, rename to `.done.md` and update the task file with implementation notes
