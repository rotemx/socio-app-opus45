## Description

Configure Dependabot to group related packages together and ignore incompatible major versions to prevent fragmented upgrade PRs that cause peer dependency conflicts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] NestJS packages grouped together
- [ ] React packages grouped together
- [ ] React Native packages grouped together
- [ ] Incompatible versions ignored (React 19, Tailwind 4)
- [ ] Future PRs come as coordinated groups

## Technical Notes

### Configuration to Add

Create or update `.github/dependabot.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    groups:
      nestjs:
        patterns:
          - "@nestjs/*"
      react-web:
        patterns:
          - "react"
          - "react-dom"
          - "@types/react"
          - "@types/react-dom"
      react-native:
        patterns:
          - "react-native"
          - "@react-native/*"
          - "@react-navigation/*"
      vite:
        patterns:
          - "vite"
          - "@vitejs/*"
      testing:
        patterns:
          - "jest"
          - "@types/jest"
          - "ts-jest"
    ignore:
      # React 19 incompatible with React Native
      - dependency-name: "react"
        versions: [">=19.0.0"]
      - dependency-name: "react-dom"
        versions: [">=19.0.0"]
      # Tailwind v4 incompatible with NativeWind v4
      - dependency-name: "tailwindcss"
        versions: [">=4.0.0"]
      # Jest 30 waiting for ts-jest 30
      - dependency-name: "jest"
        versions: [">=30.0.0"]
```

## Implementation Notes

This prevents future fragmented PRs like the 21 we just reviewed.
