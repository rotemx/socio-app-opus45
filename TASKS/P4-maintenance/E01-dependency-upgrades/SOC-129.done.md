## Description

Merge CI workflow PRs #4 (actions/setup-node v4->v6) and #5 (actions/upload-artifact v4->v5) which require `workflow` scope OAuth permissions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] PR #4 merged (setup-node v6)
- [x] PR #5 merged (upload-artifact v5)
- [x] CI pipeline runs successfully
- [x] Branches deleted

## Technical Notes

### Issue

These PRs failed to merge with error:
```
GraphQL: refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` without `workflow` scope
```

### Resolution Options

1. **Manual merge via GitHub UI** - User with workflow permissions merges
2. **Update OAuth token** - Add workflow scope to gh CLI token
3. **Manual git merge** - Checkout, merge, push with appropriate credentials

### PRs to Merge

- PR #4: actions/setup-node v4 -> v6
- PR #5: actions/upload-artifact v4 -> v5

Both are safe upgrades with no breaking changes affecting this project.

## Implementation Notes

PR #3 (codecov-action) was merged successfully as it doesn't require workflow scope.
